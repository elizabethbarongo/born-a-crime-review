                        <h1>WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDE</h1>

                    <p>

                        I would choose this title because it brings strong
                        images,
                        memories and feelings to the mind of a reader. It
                        would bring the reader attention closely and ask what
                        happens in the book when two worlds collide.
                        This way the reader is already inquisitive before
                        reading
                        the book creating an urge to the reader to know
                        what is happening.

                        The title highlights Noah’s position between the white
                        and
                        black worlds of South Africa.

                <div class="title">
                    <h1>GROWING UP UNDER ARPATHEID</h1>
                </div>
                <p>

                    It describes how Trevor Noah’s life was shaped by racial
                    segregation, the illegality of his birth between a
                    black woman and a white man which was a crime at that time
                    in South Africa.
                    It shows how his birth was a violation of the law under the
                    apartheid rule.
                    Highlights the experience of apartheid that was represented
                    with poverty among the blacks having Trevor been
                    born by a black woman and the constant struggle to navigate
                    a world where he is considered a crime in
                    instances where he had no right of freedom as his movement
                    was limited .
