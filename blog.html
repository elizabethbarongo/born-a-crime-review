                <p>Gender roles and relationship expectations seem to be
                    outdated to some people and not outdated to other people.
                    .There are certain gender roles in a relationship that men
                    and women are taught and pressured to fit into.Where a man
                    is strong and takes financial care of the family while a
                    woman’s chore is to
                    take care of the children,do the dishes,nurture and take
                    emotional care of everyone.
                    In the modern society, gender roles and relationships are
                    evolving and moving away from the traditional defined roles
                    for
                    each gender.While traditional roles, such as women taking
                    care
                    of children and men taking the task of financial care are
                    still
                    present there is trends in more flexible
                    expectation.Relationship expectations are changing with
                    increased emphasis on communication, equality ,
                    mutual-respect,
                    quality-time and acts of service.</p>

                    <p>Societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles is
                    slowly decreasing but still exists. For example, women are
                    pursuing careers traditionally held by men. This is marked
                    by an
                    increasing number of women in men's fields such as the
                    engineering role and men are talking more on childcare
                    responsibilities.

                    Relationships are increasingly based on equality, with
                    partners
                    sharing responsibilities, making decisions together and
                    respecting each other’s opinion. Example; Nowadays if a ma
                    gets earlier from work he prepares a meal for the family
                    instead
                    of waiting for the woman to cook saying that it’s a woman’s
                    task to cook and not a man hence defying the odds of the
                    traditional
                    gender roles where a man was not supposed to be in the
                    kitchen for whatsoever reason.

                    Partner’s are expected to respect each other‘s boundaries,
                    support each other’s goals, and create a supportive
                    environment.This means that couples need to treat each other

                    in a thoughtful and courteous way.Example, avoid name
                    calling
                    andinsults between each other.

                    Relationships are less about fitting into rigid roles and
                    more

                    about celebrating individual differences and finding ways to
                    accommodate them. By appreciating and acknowledging
                    individual

                    differences relationships can become stronger and more
                    fulfilling.Example, being married to a different culture a
                    man

                    can assist the woman in accommodating into the culture and
                    teaching her more about the culture rather than forcing them
                    into the culture.</p>
